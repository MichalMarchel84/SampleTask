#Sample Task
##Technology
As task description forbids using frameworks, it was implemented 
using servlet technology. Application is configured to use MySQL database, 
however, it can be altered easily by modifying context.xml and pom.xml. 
Lombok @Data annotation was used to hide getters/setters/constructors at 
BlogEntry and User entities (for better readability).
